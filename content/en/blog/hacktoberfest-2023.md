Hacktoberfest 2023 is here, and we are excited to announce that Kairos is taking part by creating some good first issues
for new contributors to get started with and also by hosting a Hacktoberfest event on October 19th in Brussels.

## Why is Hacktoberfest important to us?

We believe in open source, this is why all of Kairos' source code is fully open-sourced, but our commitment doesn't stop
there, we also want to help developers, students and anyone interested to learn more about open source and how they can
contribute to it.

## Why is Kairos a good project to contribute to?

Kairos is one of those projects that touches many different areas of software development, from the frontend to the
backend. While code is what makes Kairos work, our project would not be easy to use without the documentation, and it
would not be possible to maintain without the community.

### For users

If you are a user of Kairos, you can help us by reporting bugs, requesting features, or even by writing documentation.
No matter how small you think your contribution is, it will help us make Kairos better for everyone.

### For developers

Whether you are an experienced developer or just getting started, Kairos has something to offer. This means you can
contribute to the project using the skills you already have, or you can learn new ones. You don't need to be an expert
in any of these areas to contribute, we are here to help you learn and grow. Have a look at our stack: 

- Coding
  - Go
  - Shell scripting
  - JavaScript
  - Testing
- Linux
  - Distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc)
  - Init systems (Systemd and OpenRC)
  - Package managers
  - Initramfs
  - Dracut
  - Immutability
- Containers and Dockerfiles management
- Kubernetes
- Static Site Generators
- Edge computing
- User Interfaces
  - Web
  - Command Line

Plus you can also learn about unique Kairos related projects like:

- [Luet package manager](https://github.com/mudler/luet)
- [Immucore](https://github.com/kairos-io/immucore/)
- [EdgeVPN](https://mudler.github.io/edgevpn/)

## How can you contribute?

Contributions can be anything from a typo fix to a new feature, we are open to all kinds of contributions. It doesn't
even need to be code, you can also contribute by writing documentation, creating issues, or helping other contributors.

You can start by looking at the issues labeled [hacktoberfest](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest)
on our main GitHub repository but feel free to look at any other issue that you find interesting. If nothing feels like
a good fit for you, you can always reach out to us in our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/spectrocloudcommunity/shared_invite/zt-1k7wsz840-ugSsPKzZCP5gkasJ0kNpqw) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#kairos-io:matrix.org) channels, we are there to help!

## Hacktoberfest 2023 in Brussels

If you would like to meet us in person, we are hosting a Hacktoberfest event in Brussels on October 19th. We will give
a short presentation about open-source and how to contribute to your favorite projects. After that, we will have a few
hours to hack together and help you get started with your first contribution whether on Kairos or any other project of
your preference. We will also have some food and drinks to keep us going.

The event will take place in the [Ring Twice](https://ringtwice.be/) office in Brussels, Belgium. The address is
Cantersteen 10, 1000 Bruxelles. We will start at 18:00 and will end at 22:00.
