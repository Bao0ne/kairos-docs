We’re thrilled to announce that since April 2024, Kairos has been officially part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a Sandbox Project. This marks an important milestone for Kairos and, more importantly, for our entire community of users and contributors.

You might be wondering - what does being part of the CNCF mean for you? The CNCF is known for backing the most innovative, reliable, and secure projects in the cloud-native space, and having their support brings a number of crucial benefits. Let’s dive into why this matters.

## Stability and Long-Term Support

First and foremost, being part of the CNCF ensures that Kairos is built to last. The CNCF provides a stable and structured environment that safeguards against a project disappearing overnight, something that can be a concern for open-source users. With CNCF backing us, you can rest assured that Kairos is part of a thriving, open-source ecosystem with the resources and backing to stay sustainable for the long term.

## Higher Standards and Best Practices

We've been quiet about this milestone until now because the CNCF onboarding process is rigorous, and we wanted to make sure we did it right. This onboarding process wasn’t just about paperwork—it pushed us to adopt even higher levels of best practices. You can see some of the measures we've adopted as part of this effort [here](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/9100). These improvements have been critical in refining Kairos, and we've emerged from the onboarding process more secure, more reliable, and better aligned with industry standards.

## Growing and Collaborating with the Cloud Native Community

Joining the CNCF has opened many doors for us to connect with other projects and communities. This past year, we've had the privilege of participating in KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Hong Kong as part of the Project Pavilion, where we had a booth to engage with users and fellow contributors. We’ll be doing the same at KubeCon North America, and we’d love to see you there!

Come visit us on Wednesday, November 13, from 10:30 am to 3:15 pm at the Project Pavilion area of KubeCon North America. Through these events, we've had the chance to collaborate with other CNCF project maintainers, share knowledge, and learn from one another. The spirit of open collaboration is at the heart of everything we do, and we’ve gained valuable insights that are helping us make Kairos even better for you, our users.

## Improved CI with ARM Support

Another benefit of being part of the CNCF is access to resources we didn't have before. Thanks to the CNCF, we now have ARM machines integrated into our CI pipelines, allowing us to test and build more efficiently. This not only speeds up our development process but also ensures Kairos runs smoothly on a wider range of hardware platforms, enhancing performance and broadening the scope of where you can use it.

## A Community Effort

Finally, we want to emphasize that none of this would have been possible without you—our community. Your support, feedback, and contributions are what drive Kairos forward. Whether it’s through submitting pull requests, reporting issues, or simply sharing your experiences, you have been an integral part of our journey. We are grateful to have such a passionate and engaged community that keeps us motivated and moving in the right direction.

As we continue to grow within the CNCF and the cloud-native space, we’re excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We remain committed to building Kairos in a way that benefits all of us, and we can’t wait to share more with you in the future.

See you at KubeCon North America, and thank you for being with us every step of the way!
